# Heart Failure Analysis

This repository provides an end-to-end pipeline for analyzing heart failure data. It leverages machine learning techniques and statistical analysis to identify key factors contributing to heart failure and predict the likelihood of heart failure in patients. The project includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and visualization of insights.
